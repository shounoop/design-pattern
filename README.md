# design-pattern
  Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that software encounter while designing and developing software applications.
  These patterns provide a standard approach to solve a particular problem, which has been proven over time to be effective and efficient.
  
- There are three types of design patterns:
  1. Creational Patterns
    - These patterns are used to create objects in a way that is suitable for a particular situation.
    - Examples of creational patterns incluse: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype.
    
  2. Structural Patterns
    - These patterns are used to provide a way to organize objects in a particular structure.
    - Examples of structural patterns include: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, and Proxy.
  
  3. Behavioral Patterns
    - These patterns are used to manage communication and behavior between objects in a system.
    - Examples of behavioral patterns incluse: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observe, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Visitor.

--> Design patterns are a valuable tool for software developers as they provide proven solutions to common problems. By using design patterns, developers can save time and effort, reduce errors, and improve the quanlity of their software applications.
